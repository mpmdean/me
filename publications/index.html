    <p>The Kitaev quantum spin liquid epitomizes an entangled topological state, for which two flavors of fractionalized low-energy excitations are predicted: the itinerant Majorana fermion and the Z2 gauge flux. It was proposed recently that fingerprints of fractional excitations are encoded in the phonon spectra of Kitaev quantum spin liquids through a novel fractional-excitation-phonon coupling. Here, we detect anomalous phonon effects in α-RuCl<sub>3</sub> using inelastic X-ray scattering with meV resolution. At high temperature, we discover interlaced optical phonons intercepting a transverse acoustic phonon between 3 and 7 meV. Upon decreasing temperature, the optical phonons display a large intensity enhancement near the Kitaev energy, JK 8 meV, that coincides with a giant acoustic phonon softening near the Z2 gauge flux energy scale. These phonon anomalies signify the coupling of phonon and Kitaev magnetic excitations in α-RuCl<sub>3</sub> and demonstrates a proof-of-principle method to detect anomalous excitations in topological quantum materials.</p>

    <p>Topological states in quantum materials are defined by bulk wave functions that possess nontrivial topological invariants. While edge modes are widely presented as signatures of nontrivial topology, how bulk wave functions can manifest explicitly topological properties remains unresolved. Here, using high-resolution inelastic x-ray spectroscopy (IXS) combined with first principles calculations, we report experimental signatures of chiral wave functions in the bulk phonon spectrum of BaPtGe, which we show to host a previously undiscovered twofold-degenerate quadruple Weyl node. The chirality of the degenerate phononic wave function yields a nontrivial phonon dynamical structure factor, S(Q,ω), along high-symmetry directions, that is in excellent agreement with numerical and model calculations. Our results establish IXS as a powerful tool to uncover topological wave functions, providing a key missing ingredient in the study of topological quantum matter.</p>

    <p>Revealing the predominant driving force behind symmetry breaking in correlated materials is sometimes a formidable task due to the intertwined nature of different degrees of freedom. This is the case for La<sub>2-x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>NiO<sub>4+δ</sub>, in which coupled incommensurate charge and spin stripes form at low temperatures. Here, we use resonant x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy to study the temporal stability and domain memory of the charge and spin stripes in La<sub>2-x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>NiO<sub>4+δ</sub>. Although spin stripes are more spatially correlated, charge stripes maintain a better temporal stability against temperature change. More intriguingly, charge order shows robust domain memory with thermal cycling up to 250 K, far above the ordering temperature. These results demonstrate the pinning of charge stripes to the lattice and that charge condensation is the predominant factor in the formation of stripe orders in nickelates.</p>

    <p>The unconventional normal-state properties of the cuprates are often discussed in terms of emergent electronic order that onsets below a putative critical doping of x<sub>c</sub>=0.19. Charge density wave (CDW) correlations represent one such order; however, experimental evidence for such order generally spans a limited range of doping that falls short of the critical value x<sub>c</sub>, leading to questions regarding its essential relevance. Here, we use X-ray diffraction to demonstrate that CDW correlations in La<sub>2−x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> persist up to a doping of at least x=0.21. The correlations show strong changes through the superconducting transition, but no obvious discontinuity through x<sub>c</sub>=0.19, despite changes in Fermi surface topology and electronic transport at this doping. These results demonstrate the interaction between CDWs and superconductivity even in overdoped cuprates and prompt a reconsideration of the role of CDW correlations in the high-temperature cuprate phase diagram.</p>

  <span class="abstract hidden">
    <p>The discovery of superconductivity in a d<sup>9-δ</sup> nickelate has inspired disparate theoretical perspectives regarding the essential physics of this class of materials. A key issue is the magnitude of the magnetic superexchange, which relates to whether cuprate-like high-temperature nickelate superconductivity could be realized. We address this question using Ni L-edge and O K-edge spectroscopy of the reduced d<sup>9-1/3</sup> trilayer nickelates R4Ni3O8 (where R=La, Pr) and associated theoretical modeling. A magnon energy scale of ∼80 meV
 resulting from a nearest-neighbor magnetic exchange of J=69(4) meV is observed, proving that d<sup>9-δ</sup> nickelates can host a large superexchange. This value, along with that of the Ni-O hybridization estimated from our O K-edge data, implies that trilayer nickelates represent an intermediate case between the infinite-layer nickelates and the cuprates. Layered nickelates thus provide a route to testing the relevance of superexchange to nickelate superconductivity.</p>

    <p>Ultrafast manipulation of magnetic states holds great promise for progress in our understanding of new quantum states and technical applications, but our current knowledge of transient magnetism is very limited. Our work elucidates the nature of transient magnetism in gapped antiferromagnets using Sr<sub>3</sub>Ir<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> as a model material. We find that transient magnetic fluctuations are trapped throughout the entire Brillouin zone while remaining present beyond the time that is required to restore the original spin network. The results are interpreted in the context of a spin-bottleneck effect, in which the existence of an explicit magnetic decay channel allows for an efficient thermalization of transient spin waves.Although ultrafast manipulation of magnetism holds great promise for new physical phenomena and applications, targeting specific states is held back by our limited understanding of how magnetic correlations evolve on ultrafast timescales. Using ultrafast resonant inelastic X-ray scattering we demonstrate that femtosecond laser pulses can excite transient magnons at large wavevectors in gapped antiferromagnets and that they persist for several picoseconds, which is opposite to what is observed in nearly gapless magnets. Our work suggests that materials with isotropic magnetic interactions are preferred to achieve rapid manipulation of magnetism.</p>

    <p>Observations of spontaneous breaking of the rotational symmetry in an electron fluid, the so-called “electronic nematicity,” have been reported in several quantum materials. We have developed several different methods, based on angle-resolved transport measurements, to determine the amplitude and the director of the nematic order. We present methods that are applicable to thin films or single crystals, illustrate them with transport data obtained on copper oxide superconductors, and discuss their relative advantages and disadvantages.</p>

    <p>The discovery of charge-density-wave-related effects in the resonant inelastic x-ray scattering spectra of cuprates holds the tantalizing promise of clarifying the interactions that stabilize the electronic order. Here, we report a comprehensive resonant inelastic x-ray scattering study of La2−xSrxCuO4 finding that chargedensity wave effects persist up to a remarkably high doping level of x=0.21 before disappearing at x = 0.25. The inelastic excitation spectra remain essentially unchanged with doping despite crossing a topological transition in the Fermi surface. This indicates that the spectra contain little or no direct coupling to electronic excitations near the Fermi surface, rather they are dominated by the resonant cross section for phonons and charge-density-wave-induced phonon softening. We interpret our results in terms of a chargedensity wave that is generated by strong correlations and a phonon response that is driven by the chargedensity-wave-induced modification of the lattice.</p>

    <p>We report on the epitaxial strain-driven electronic and antiferromagnetic modulations of a pseudospin-half square-lattice realized in superlattices of (SrIrO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>1</sub>/(SrTiO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>1</sub>. With increasing compressive strain, we find the low-temperature insulating behavior to be strongly suppressed with a corresponding systematic reduction of both the Néel temperature and the staggered moment. However, despite such a suppression, the system remains weakly insulating above the Néel transition. The emergence of metallicity is observed under large compressive strain but only at temperatures far above the Néel transition. These behaviors are characteristics of the Slater-Mott crossover regime, providing a unique experimental model system of the spin-half Hubbard Hamiltonian with a tunable intermediate coupling strength.</p>

    <p>Structural symmetry breaking and recovery in condensed-matter systems are closely related to exotic physical properties such as superconductivity (SC), magnetism, spin density waves, and charge density waves (CDWs). The interplay between different order parameters is intricate and often subject to intense debate, as in the case of CDW order and superconductivity. In La<sub>2−x</sub>Ba<sub>x</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> (LBCO), the low-temperature structural domain walls are hypothesized as nanometer-scale pinning sites for the CDWs. Coherent x-ray diffraction techniques have been employed here to visualize the domain structures associated with these symmetry changes directly during phase transition. We have pushed Bragg coherent diffractive imaging (BCDI) into the cryogenic regime where most phase transitions in quantum materials reside. Utilizing BCDI, we image the structural evolution of LBCO microcrystal samples during the high-temperature tetragonal to low-temperature orthorhombic (LTO) phase transition. Our results show the formation of LTO domains close to the transition temperature and how the domain size decreases with temperature. The number of domains follows the secondary order parameter (or orthorhombic strain) measurement with a critical exponent that is consistent with the three-dimensional universality class.</p>

    <p>Electron correlations play a dominant role in the charge dynamics of the cuprates. We use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to track the doping dependence of the collective charge excitations in electron doped La<sub>2-x</sub>Ce<sub>x</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> (LCCO). From the resonant energy dependence and the out-of-plane momentum dependence, the charge excitations are identified as three-dimensional (3D) plasmons, which reflect the nature of the electronic structure and Coulomb repulsion on both short and long lengthscales. With increasing electron doping, the plasmon excitations increase monotonically in energy, a consequence of the electron correlation effect on electron structure near the Fermi surface (FS). Importantly, the plasmon excitations evolve from a broad feature into a well-defined peak with much increased life time, revealing the evolution of the electrons from incoherent states to coherent quasi-particles near the FS. Such evolution marks the reduction of the short-range electronic correlation, and thus the softening of the Mottness of the system with increasing electron doping.</p>

    <p>5d iridates have shown vast emergent phenomena due to a strong interplay among their lattice, charge, and spin degrees of freedom, because of which the potential in spintronic application of the thin-film form is highly leveraged. Here we have epitaxially stabilized perovskite SrIr<sub>0.8</sub>Sn<sub>0.2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> on [001] SrTiO<sub>3</sub> substrates through pulsed laser deposition and systematically characterized the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties. Physical property measurements unravel an insulating ground state with a weak ferromagnetism in the compressively strained epitaxial film. The octahedral rotation pattern is identified by synchrotron x-ray diffraction, resolving a mix of a+b−c− and a−b+c− domains. X-ray magnetic resonant scattering directly demonstrates a G-type antiferromagnetic structure of the magnetic order and the spin canting nature of the weak ferromagnetism.</p>

    <p>While condensed matter systems host both fermionic and bosonic quasiparticles, reliably predicting and empirically verifying topological states is only mature for Fermionic electronic structures, leaving
topological Bosonic excitations sporadically explored. This is unfortunate, as Bosonic systems such as
phonons offer the opportunity to assess spinless band structures where nodal lines can be realized without
invoking special additional symetries to protect against spin-orbit coupling. Here we combine firstprinciples calculations and meV-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering to demonstrate the first realization of
parity-time reversal symmetry protected helical nodal lines in the phonon spectrum of MoB<sub>2</sub>. This structure is unique to phononic systems as the spin-orbit coupling present in electronic systems tends to lift the
degeneracy away from high-symmetry locations. Our study establishes a protocol to accurately identify
topological Bosonic excitations, opening a new route to explore exotic topological states in crystalline
materials.</p>

    <p>As a hallmark of electronic correlation, spin-charge interplay underlies many emergent phenomena in doped Mott insulators, such as high-temperature superconductivity, whereas the half-filled parent state is usually electronically frozen with an antiferromagnetic order that resists external control. We report on the observation of a positive magnetoresistance that probes the staggered susceptibility of a pseudospin-half square-lattice Mott insulator built as an artificial SrIrO3/SrTiO3 superlattice. Its size is particularly large in the high-temperature insulating paramagnetic phase near the Néel transition. This magnetoresistance originates from a collective charge response to the large longitudinal spin fluctuations under a linear coupling between the external magnetic field and the staggered magnetization enabled by strong spin-orbit interaction. Our results demonstrate a magnetic control of the binding energy of the fluctuating particle-hole pairs in the Slater-Mott crossover regime analogous to the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-to-Bose-Einstein condensation crossover of ultracold-superfluids.</p>

    <p>Many remarkable properties of quantum materials emerge from states with intricate coupling between the charge, spin and orbital degrees of freedom. Ultrafast photo-excitation of these materials holds great promise for understanding and controlling the properties of these states. Here, we introduce time-resolved resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (tr-RIXS) as a means of measuring the charge, spin and orbital excitations out of equilibrium. These excitations encode the correlations and interactions that determine the detailed properties of the states generated. After outlining the basic principles and instrumentations of tr-RIXS, we review our first observations of transient antiferromagnetic correlations in quasi two dimensions in a photo-excited Mott insulator and present possible future routes of this fast-developing technique. The increasing number of X-ray free electron laser facilities not only enables tackling long-standing fundamental scientific problems, but also promises to unleash novel inelastic X-ray scattering spectroscopies.</p>

    <p>Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) has become a very powerful experimental technique to probe a broad range of intrinsic elementary excitations, for example, from low energy phonons and (bi-)magnons to high energy -, charge-transfer and plasmon excitations in strongly correlated electronic systems. Due to the complexity of the RIXS cross-section and strong core-hole effects, theoretical simulation of the experimental RIXS spectra is still a difficult task which hampers the understanding of RIXS spectra and the development of the RIXS technique. In this paper, we present an open source toolkit (dubbed EDRIXS) to facilitate the simulations of RIXS spectra of strongly correlated materials based on exact diagonalization (ED) of certain model Hamiltonians. The model Hamiltonian can be from a single atom, small cluster or Anderson impurity model, with model parameters from density functional theory plus Wannier90 or dynamical mean-field theory calculations. The spectra of x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and RIXS are then calculated using Krylov subspace techniques. This toolkit contains highly efficient ED, XAS and RIXS solvers written in modern Fortran 90 language and a convenient Python library used to prepare inputs and set up calculations. We first give a short introduction to RIXS spectroscopy, and then we discuss the implementation details of this toolkit. Finally, we show three examples to demonstrate its usage.</p>

    <p>Abstract Interface-induced modifications of the electronic, magnetic, and lattice degrees of freedom drive an array of novel physical properties in oxide heterostructures. Here, large changes in metal–oxygen band hybridization, as measured in the oxygen ligand hole density, are induced as a result of interfacing two isovalent correlated oxides. Using resonant X-ray reflectivity, a superlattice of SrFeO<sub>3</sub> and CaFeO<sub>3</sub> is shown to exhibit an electronic character that spatially evolves from strongly O-like in SrFeO3 to strongly Fe-like in CaFeO<sub>3</sub>. This alternating degree of Fe electronic character is correlated with a modulation of an Fe 3d orbital polarization, giving rise to an orbital superstructure. At the SrFeO<sub>3</sub>/CaFeO<sub>3</sub> interfaces, the ligand hole density and orbital polarization reconstruct in a single unit cell of CaFeO<sub>3</sub>, demonstrating how the mismatch in these electronic parameters is accommodated at the interface. These results provide new insight into how the orbital character of electrons is altered by correlated oxide interfaces and lays out a broadly applicable approach for depth-resolving band hybridization.</p>

    <p>Although charge density waves (CDWs) are omnipresent in cuprate high-temperature superconductors, they occur at significantly different wave vectors, confounding efforts to understand their formation mechanism. Here, we use resonant inelastic x-ray scattering to investigate the doping- and temperature-dependent CDW evolution in La<sub>2-x</sub>Ba<sub>x</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> (x=0.115–0.155). We discover that the CDW develops in two stages with decreasing temperature. A precursor CDW with a quasicommensurate wave vector emerges first at high temperature. This doping-independent precursor CDW correlation originates from the CDW phase mode coupled with a phonon and “seeds” the low-temperature CDW with a strongly doping-dependent wave vector. Our observation reveals the precursor CDW and its phase mode as the building blocks of the highly intertwined electronic ground state in the cuprates.</p>

    <p>Through a combination of experimental measurements and theoretical modeling, we describe a strongly orbital-polarized insulating ground state in an
(LaTiO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>/(LaCoO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>
 oxide heterostructure. X-ray absorption spectra and ab initio calculations show that an electron is transferred from the titanate to the cobaltate layers. The charge transfer, accompanied by a large octahedral distortion, induces a substantial orbital polarization in the cobaltate layer of a size unattainable via epitaxial strain alone. The asymmetry between in-plane and out-of-plane orbital occupancies in the high-spin cobaltate layer is predicted by theory and observed through x-ray linear dichroism experiments. Manipulating orbital configurations using interfacial coupling within heterostructures promises exciting ground-state engineering for realizing new emergent electronic phases in metal oxide superlattices.</p>

    <p>The mixing of orbital and spin character in the wave functions of the 5d iridates has led to predictions of strong couplings among their lattice, electronic, and magnetic degrees of freedom. As well as realizing a novel spin-orbit assisted Mott-insulating ground state, the perovskite iridate Sr<sub>2</sub>IrO<sub>4</sub> has strong similarities with the cuprate La<sub>2</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub>, which on doping hosts a charge-density wave that appears intimately connected to high-temperature superconductivity. These phenomena can be sensitively probed through momentum-resolved measurements of the lattice dynamics, made possible by meV-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering. Here we report the first such measurements for both parent and electron-doped Sr<sub>2</sub>IrO<sub>4</sub>. We find that the low-energy phonon dispersions and intensities in both compounds are well described by the same nonmagnetic density functional theory calculation. In the parent compound, no changes of the phonons on magnetic ordering are discernible within the experimental resolution, and in the doped compound no anomalies are apparent due to charge-density waves. These measurements extend our knowledge of the lattice properties of (Sr<sub>1−x</sub>La<sub>x</sub>)<sub>2</sub>IrO<sub>4</sub> and constrain the couplings of the phonons to magnetic and charge order.</p>

    <p>Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) experiments have been carried out at the Advanced Photon Source using a new cryostat system developed to achieve high mechanical stability and low vibrations. We measured the (012)<sub>LTO</sub> Bragg peak which is unique to the low-temperature orthorhombic (LTO) phase of micron-sized crystals of the high-temperature superconductor La<sub>2−x</sub>Ba<sub>x</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> (LBCO) to study the formation of structural domains. Each time the sample was cooled into the orthorhombic phase, the diffraction pattern of domains was different. This confirms the interpretation of pinning of the lower-temperature charge density Wave domains observed in coherent resonant X-ray speckle correlation analysis experiments.</p>

    <p>We present a methodology based on ex situ (postgrowth) electrochemistry to control the oxygen concentration in thin films of the superconducting oxide La<sub>2</sub>CuO<sub>4+y</sub>
 grown epitaxially on substrates of isostructural LaSrAlO<sub>4</sub>. The superconducting transition temperature, which depends on the oxygen concentration, can be tuned by adjusting the pH level of the base solution used for the electrochemical reaction. As our main finding, we demonstrate that the dopant oxygens can either occupy the interstitial layer in an orientationally disordered state or organize into a crystalline phase via a mechanism in which dopant oxygens are inserted into the substrate, changing the lattice symmetry of both the substrate and the epitaxial film. We discuss this mechanism, and we describe the resulting methodology as a platform to be explored in thin films of other transition-metal oxides.</p>

    <p>Recent years have seen many examples of how the strong spin-orbit coupling present in iridates can stabilize new emergent states that are difficult or impossible to realize in more conventional materials. In this review we outline a representative set of studies detailing how heterostructures based on Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) iridates can be used to access yet more novel physics. Beginning with a short synopsis of iridate thin film growth, the effects of the heterostructure morphology on the RP iridates including Sr2IrO4 and SrIrO3 are discussed. Example studies explore the effects of epitaxial strain, laser-excitation to access transient states, topological semimetallicity in SrIrO3, 2D magnetism in artificial RP iridates, and interfacial magnetic coupling between iridate and neighboring layers. Taken together, these works show the fantastic potential for controlled engineering of novel quantum phenomena in iridate heterostructures.</p>

    <p>Ruddlesden-Popper type Sr<sub>n+1</sub>Ir<sub>n</sub>O<sub>3n+1</sub> compounds are a major focus of condensed matter physics, where the subtle balance between electron-electron correlation, spin–orbit interaction, and crystal field effect brings a host of emergent phenomena. While it is understandable that a canted antiferromagnetic insulating state with an easy-plane anisotropy is developed in Sr<sub>2</sub>IrO<sub>4</sub> as the two-dimensional limit of the series, it is intriguing that bilayer Sr<sub>3</sub>Ir<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, with slightly higher effective dimensionality, stabilizes c-axis collinear antiferromagnetism. This also renders Sr3Ir2O7 a unique playground to study exotic physics near a critical spin transition point. However, the epitaxial growth of Sr3Ir2O7 is still a challenging task because of the narrow growth window. In our research, we have studied the thermodynamic process during the synthesis of Sr<sub>3</sub>Ir<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> thin films. We expanded the synthesis window by mapping out the relationship between the thin film crystal structure and the gas pressure. Our work thus provides a more accessible avenue to stabilize metastable materials.</p>

    <p>Although CDW correlations are a ubiquitous feature of the superconducting cuprates, their disparate properties suggest a crucial role for pinning the CDW to the lattice. Here, we report coherent resonant X-ray speckle correlation analysis, which directly determines the reproducibility of CDW domain patterns in La<sub>1.875</sub>Ba<sub>0.125</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> (LBCO 1/8) with thermal cycling. While CDW order is only observed below 54 K, where a structural phase transition creates inequivalent Cu-O bonds, we discover remarkably reproducible CDW domain memory upon repeated cycling to far higher temperatures. That memory is only lost on cycling to 240(3) K, which recovers the four-fold symmetry of the CuO<sub>2</sub> planes. We infer that the structural features that develop below 240 K determine the CDW pinning landscape below 54 K. This opens a view into the complex coupling between charge and lattice degrees of freedom in superconducting cuprates.</p>

    <p>Fundamental control of magnetic coupling through heterostructure morphology is a prerequisite for rational engineering of magnetic ground states. We report the tuning of magnetic interactions in superlattices composed of single and bilayers of SrIrO<sub>3</sub> inter-spaced with SrTiO<sub>3</sub> in analogy to the Ruddlesden-Popper series iridates. Magnetic scattering shows predominately c-axis antiferromagnetic orientation of the magnetic moments for the bilayer, as in Sr<sub>3</sub>Ir<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>. However, the magnetic excitation gap, measured by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, is quite different between the two structures, evidencing a significant change in the stability of the competing magnetic phases. In contrast, the single layer iridate hosts a more bulk-like gap. We find these changes are driven by bending of the c-axis Ir-O-Ir bond, which is much weaker in the single layer, and subsequent local environment changes, evidenced through x-ray diffraction and magnetic excitation modeling. Our findings demonstrate how large changes in the magnetic interactions can be tailored and probed in spin-orbit coupled heterostructures by engineering subtle structural modulations.</p>

    <p>The electronic states of many Mott insulators, including iridates, are often conceptualized in terms of localized atomic states such as the famous “J<sub>eff</sub>=1/2 state.” Although orbital hybridization can strongly modify such states and dramatically change the electronic properties of materials, probing this process is highly challenging. In this Letter, we directly detect and quantify the formation of dimer orbitals in an iridate material Ba<sub>5</sub>AlIr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>11</sub> using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering. Sharp peaks corresponding to the excitations of dimer orbitals are observed and analyzed by a combination of density functional theory calculations and theoretical simulations based on an Ir-Ir cluster model. Such partially delocalized dimer states lead to a redefinition of the angular momentum of the electrons and changes in the magnetic and electronic behaviors of the material. We use this to explain the reduction of the observed magnetic moment with respect to predictions based on atomic states. This study opens new directions to study dimerization in a large family of materials, including solids, heterostructures, molecules, and transient states.</p>

    <p>We report the observation of multiple phonon satellite features in ultrathin superlattices of the form nSrIrO<sub>3</sub>/<sub>m</sub>SrTiO<sub>3</sub> using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). As the values of n and m vary, the energy loss spectra show a systematic evolution in the relative intensity of the phonon satellites. Using a closed-form solution for the RIXS cross section, we extract the variation in the electron-phonon coupling strength as a function of n and m. Combined with the negligible carrier doping into the SrTiO<sub>3</sub> layers, these results indicate that the tuning of the electron-phonon coupling can be effectively decoupled from doping. This work both showcases a feasible method to extract the electron-phonon coupling in superlattices and unveils a potential route for tuning this coupling, which is often associated with superconductivity in SrTiO<sub>3</sub>-based systems.</p>

    <p>Manipulating the orbital occupation of valence electrons via epitaxial strain in an effort to induce new functional properties requires considerations of how changes in the local bonding environment affect the band structure at the Fermi level. Using synchrotron radiation to measure the x-ray linear dichroism of epitaxially strained films of the correlated oxide CaFeO3, we demonstrate that the orbital polarization of the Fe valence electrons is opposite from conventional understanding. Although the energetic ordering of the Fe $3d$ orbitals is confirmed by multiplet ligand field theory analysis to be consistent with previously reported strain-induced behavior, we find that the nominally higher energy orbital is more populated than the lower. We ascribe this inverted orbital polarization to an anisotropic bandwidth response to strain in a compound with nearly filled bands. These findings provide an important counterexample to the traditional understanding of strain-induced orbital polarization and reveal a method to engineer otherwise unachievable orbital occupations in correlated oxides.</p>

    <p>Manipulating magnetic domains is essential for many technological applications. Recent breakthroughs in Antiferromagnetic Spintronics brought up novel concepts for electronic device development. Imaging antiferromagnetic domains is of key importance to this field. Unfortunately, some of the basic domain types, such as antiphase domains, cannot be imaged by conventional techniques. Herein, we present a new domain projection imaging technique based on the localization of domain boundaries by resonant magnetic diffraction of coherent X rays. Contrast arises from reduction of the scattered intensity at the domain boundaries due to destructive interference effects. We demonstrate this approach by imaging antiphase domains in a collinear antiferromagnet Fe<sub>2</sub>Mo<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, and observe evidence of domain wall interaction with a structural defect. This technique does not involve any numerical algorithms. It is fast, sensitive, produces large-scale images in a single-exposure measurement, and is applicable to a variety of magnetic domain types.</p>

    <p>The nature of the magnetic order in (La<sub>2/3</sub>Sr<sub>1/3</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>9</sub>/(LaNiO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> superlattices is investigated using x-ray resonant magnetic reflectometry. We observe a new c-axis magnetic helix state in the (LaNiO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> layers that had never been reported in nickelates, and which mediates the  130deg magnetic coupling between the ferromagnetic (La<sub>2/3</sub>Sr<sub>1/3</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>9</sub> layers, illustrating the power of x-rays for discovering the magnetic state of complex oxide interfaces. Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering and x-ray absorption spectroscopy show that Ni-O ligand hole states from bulk LaNiO<sub>3</sub> are mostly filled due to interfacial electron transfer from Mn, driving the Ni orbitals closer to an atomic-like 3d<sup>8</sup> configuration. We discuss the constraints imposed by this electronic configuration to the microscopic origin of the observed magnetic structure. The presence of a magnetic helix in (La<sub>2/3</sub>Sr<sub>1/3</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>9</sub>/(LaNiO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> is crucial for modeling the potential spintronic functionality of this system and may be important for designing emergent magnetism in novel devices in general.</p>

  <span class="abstract hidden">
    <p>Here, we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to study superconductivity that emerges in two extreme cases, from a Fermi-liquid phase (LiFeAs) and an incoherent bad-metal phase (FeTe<sub>0.55</sub>Se<sub>0.45</sub>). We find that although the electronic coherence can strongly reshape the single-particle spectral function in the superconducting state, it is decoupled from the maximum-superconducting-gap and 2Δ<sub>max</sub>/k<sub>B</sub>T<sub>c</sub>, which shows a universal scaling that is valid for all iron-based superconductors (FeSCs). Our observation excludes pairing scenarios in the BCS and the BEC limit for FeSCs and calls for a universal strong-coupling pairing mechanism for the FeSCs.</p>

    <p>Condensed matter systems have now become a fertile ground to discover emerging topological quasiparticles with symmetry protected modes. While many studies have focused on fermionic excitations, the same conceptual framework can also be applied to bosons yielding new types of topological states. Motivated by Zhang et al.’s recent theoretical prediction of double Weyl phonons in transition metal monosilicides [Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 016401 (2018)], we directly measure the phonon dispersion in parity-breaking FeSi using inelastic x-ray scattering. By comparing the experimental data with theoretical calculations, we make the first observation of double Weyl points in FeSi, which will be an ideal material to explore emerging bosonic excitations and its topologically nontrivial properties.</p>

  <span class="abstract hidden">
    <p>A fundamental difference between antiferromagnets and ferromagnets is the lack of linear coupling to a uniform magnetic field due to the staggered order parameter1. Such coupling is possible via the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya (DM) interaction2,3, but at the expense of reduced antiferromagnetic (AFM) susceptibility due to the canting-induced spin anisotropy4. We solve this long-standing problem with a top-down approach that utilizes spin–orbit coupling in the presence of a hidden SU(2) symmetry. We demonstrate giant AFM responses to sub-tesla external fields by exploiting the extremely strong two-dimensional critical fluctuations preserved under a symmetry-invariant exchange anisotropy, which is built into a square lattice artificially synthesized as a superlattice of SrIrO<sub>3</sub> and SrTiO<sub>3</sub>. The observed field-induced logarithmic increase of the ordering temperature enables highly efficient control of the AFM order. Our results demonstrate that symmetry can be exploited in spin–orbit-coupled magnets to develop functional AFM materials for fast and secured spintronic devices5,6,7,8,9.</p>

    <p>While charge density wave (CDW) instabilities are ubiquitous to superconducting cuprates, the different ordering wave vectors in various cuprate families have hampered a unified description of the CDW formation mechanism. Here, we investigate the temperature dependence of the low-energy phonons in the canonical CDW-ordered cuprate La<sub>1.875</sub>Ba<sub>0.125</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub>. We discover that the phonon softening wave vector associated with CDW correlations becomes temperature dependent in the high-temperature precursor phase and changes from a wave vector of 0.238 reciprocal lattice units (r.l.u.) below the ordering transition temperature to 0.3 r.l.u. at 300 K. This high-temperature behavior shows that “214”-type cuprates can host CDW correlations at a similar wave vector to previously reported CDW correlations in non-214-type cuprates such as YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>6+δ</sub>. This indicates that cuprate CDWs may arise from the same underlying instability despite their apparently different low-temperature ordering wave vectors.</p>

    <p>Resonant elastic x-ray scattering is a powerful technique for measuring multipolar order parameters. In this paper, we theoretically and experimentally study the possibility of using this technique to detect the proposed multipolar order parameters in URu<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub> at the U-L3 edge with the electric quadrupolar transition. Based on an atomic model, we calculate the azimuthal dependence of the quadrupolar transition at the U-L3 edge. The results illustrate the potential of this technique for distinguishing different multipolar order parameters. We then perform experiments on ultraclean single crystals of URu<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub> at the U-L3 edge to search for the predicted signal, but do not detect any indications of multipolar moments within the experimental uncertainty. We theoretically estimate the orders of magnitude of the cross section and the expected count rate of the quadrupolar transition and compare them to the dipolar transitions at the U-M4 and U-L3 edges, clarifying the difficulty in detecting higher order multipolar order parameters in URu2Si2 in the current experimental setup.</p>

    <p>We report an experimental investigation of the two-dimensional Jeff=1/  antiferromagnetic Mott insulator by varying the interlayer exchange coupling in  [(SrIrO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>1</sub>, (SrTiO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>m</sub>] (m = 1, 2 and 3)  superlattices. Although all samples exhibited an insulating ground state with long-range magnetic order, temperature-dependent resistivity measurements showed a stronger insulating behavior in the m=2 and m=3 samples than the m=1 sample which displayed a clear kink at the magnetic transition. This difference indicates that the blocking effect of the excessive SrTiO<sub>3</sub> layer enhances the effective electron-electron correlation and strengthens the Mott phase. The significant reduction of the Néel temperature from 150 K for m=1 to 40 K for m=2 demonstrates that the long-range order stability in the former is boosted by a substantial interlayer exchange coupling. Resonant x-ray magnetic scattering revealed that the interlayer exchange coupling has a switchable sign, depending on the SrTiO<sub>3</sub> layer number m, for maintaining canting-induced weak ferromagnetism. The nearly unaltered transition temperature between the m=2 and the m=3 demonstrated that we have realized a two-dimensional antiferromagnet at finite temperatures with diminishing interlayer exchange coupling.</p>

    <p>Charge-density-wave (CDW) correlations feature prominently in the phase diagram of the cuprates, motivating competing theories of whether fluctuating CDW correlations aid superconductivity or whether static CDW order coexists with superconductivity in inhomogeneous or spatially modulated states. Here we report Cu L-edge resonant x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy measurements of CDW correlations in superconducting La<sub>2−x</sub>Ba<sub>x</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub>, x = 0.11. Static CDW order is shown to exist in the superconducting state at low temperatures and to persist up to at least 85% of the CDW transition temperature. We discuss the implications of our observations for how nominally competing order parameters can coexist in the cuprates.</p>

    <p>Although all superconducting cuprates display charge-ordering tendencies, their low-temperature properties are distinct, imped- ing efforts to understand the phenomena within a single con- ceptual framework. While some systems exhibit stripes of charge and spin, with a locked periodicity, others host charge den- sity waves (CDWs) without any obviously related spin order. Here we use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering to follow the evolution of charge correlations in the canonical stripe-ordered cuprate La<sub>1.875</sub>Ba<sub>0.125</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> across its ordering transition. We find that high-temperature charge correlations are unlocked from the wavevector of the spin correlations, signaling analogies to CDW phases in various other cuprates. This indicates that stripe order at low temperatures is stabilized by the coupling of otherwise inde- pendent charge and spin density waves, with important implica- tions for the relation between charge and spin correlations in the cuprates.

    <p>We report the first empirical demonstration that resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) is sensitive to collective magnetic excitations in S=1 systems by probing the Ni L<sub>3</sub> edge of La<sub>2−x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>NiO<sub>4</sub> (x=0, 0.33, 0.45). The magnetic excitation peak is asymmetric, indicating the presence of single and multi-spin-flip excitations. As the hole doping level is increased, the zone boundary magnon energy is suppressed at a much larger rate than that in hole doped cuprates. Based on the analysis of the orbital and charge excitations observed by RIXS, we argue that this difference is related to the orbital character of the doped holes in these two families. This work establishes RIXS as a probe of fundamental magnetic interactions in nickelates opening the way towards studies of heterostructures and ultrafast pump-probe experiments.</p>

    <p>By means of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering at the Cu L3 edge, we measured the spin-wave dispersion along &lt;100&gt; and &lt;110&gt; in the undoped cuprate Ca<sub>2</sub>CuO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>. The data yield a reliable estimate of the superexchange parameter J = 135 ± 4meV using a classical spin-1/2 two-dimensional Heisenberg modelwith nearest-neighbor interactions and including quantum fluctuations. Including further exchange interactions increases the estimate to J = 141 meV. The 40 meV dispersion between the magnetic Brillouin zone boundary points (1/2, 0) and (1/4, 1/4) indicates that next-nearest-neighbor interactions in this compound are intermediate between the values found in La<sub>2</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> and Sr<sub>2</sub>CuO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>. Due to the low-Z elements composing Ca<sub>2</sub>CuO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, the present results may enable a reliable comparison with the predictions of quantum many-body calculations, which would improve our understanding of the role of magnetic excitations and of electronic correlations in cuprates.</p>

    <p>We study the evolution of magnetic excitations in the disordered two-dimensional antiferromagnet
Sr<sub>2</sub>Ir<sub>1-x</sub>Ru<sub>x</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. The maximum energy of the magnetic excitation remains robust up to x = 0.77, with a gap opening at low dopings and increasing to over 150 meV at x = 0.77. At these higher Ru concentrations, the dispersive magnetic excitations in Sr<sub>2</sub>IrO<sub>4</sub> are rendered essentially momentum independent. Up to a Ru concentration of x = 0.77, both experiments and first-principles calculations show the Ir J<sub>eff</sub> = 1/2 state remains intact. The magnetic gap arises from the local interaction anisotropy in the proximity of the Ru disorder. Under the coherent potential approximation, we reproduce the experimental magnetic excitations using the disordered Heisenberg antiferromagnetic model with suppressed next-nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic coupling.</p>

    <p>The magnetic correlations within the cuprates have undergone intense scrutiny as part of efforts to understand high-temperature superconductivity. We explore the evolution of the magnetic correlations along the nodal direction of the Brillouin zone in La<sub>2−x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub>, spanning the doping phase diagram from the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator at x=0 to the metallic phase at x=0.26. Magnetic excitations along this direction are found to be systematically softened and broadened with doping, at a higher rate than the excitations along the antinodal direction. This phenomenology is discussed in terms of the nature of the magnetism in the doped cuprates. Survival of the high-energy magnetic excitations, even in the overdoped regime, indicates that these excitations are marginal to pairing, while the influence of the low-energy excitations remains ambiguous.</p>

    <p>Interfaces between correlated complex oxides are promising avenues to realize new forms of magnetism that arise as a result of charge transfer, proximity effects, and locally broken symmetries. We report on the discovery of a noncollinear magnetic structure in superlattices of the ferromagnetic metallic oxide La<sub>2/3</sub>Sr<sub>1/3</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> (LSMO) and the correlated metal LaNiO<sub>3</sub> (LNO). The exchange interaction between LSMO layers is mediated by the intervening LNO, such that the angle between the magnetization of neighboring LSMO layers varies in an oscillatory manner with the thickness of the LNO layer. The magnetic field, temperature, and spacer thickness dependence of the noncollinear structure are inconsistent with the bilinear and biquadratic interactions that are used to model the magnetic structure in conventional metallic multilayers. A model that couples the LSMO layers to a helical spin state within the LNO fits the observed behavior. We propose that the spin-helix results from the interaction between a spatially varying spin susceptibility within the LNO and interfacial charge transfer that creates localized Ni2+ states. Our work suggests a new approach to engineering noncollinear spin textures in metallic oxide heterostructures.</p>

  <span class="abstract hidden">
    <p>The occurrence of charge-density-wave (CDW) order in underdoped cuprates is now well established, although the precise nature of the CDW and its relationship with superconductivity is not. Theoretical proposals include contrasting ideas such as that pairing may be driven by CDW fluctuations or that static CDWs may intertwine with a spatially modulated superconducting wave function. We test the dynamics of CDW order in La<sub>2-x</sub>Ba<sub>x</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> by using x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy at the CDW wave vector, detected resonantly at the Cu L3 edge. We find that the CDW domains are strikingly static, with no evidence of significant fluctuations up to 2/3/4 h. We discuss the implications of these results for some of the competing theories.</p>

    <p>Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering is used to investigate the electronic origin of orbital polarization in
nickelate heterostructures taking LaTiO<sub>3</sub>−LaNiO<sub>3</sub>−3×LaAlO<sub>3</sub>, a system with exceptionally large polarization, as a model system. We find that heterostructuring generates only minor changes in the Ni 3d orbital energy levels, contradicting the often-invoked picture in which changes in orbital energy levels generate orbital polarization. Instead, O K-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrates that orbital polarization is caused by an anisotropic reconstruction of the oxygen ligand hole states. This provides an explanation for the limited success of theoretical predictions based on tuning orbital energy levels and implies that future theories should focus on anisotropic hybridization as the most effective means to drive large changes in electronic structure and realize novel emergent phenomena.</p>

    <p>The magnetic excitations in electron-doped (Sr<sub>1−x</sub>La<sub>x</sub>)<sub>2</sub>IrO<sub>4</sub> with x = 0.03 were measured using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering at the Ir L3 edge.Although much broadened, well defined dispersivemagnetic excitations were observed. Comparing with the magnetic dispersion from the undoped compound, the evolution of the magnetic excitations upon doping is highly anisotropic. Along the antinodal direction, the dispersion is almost intact. On the other hand, the magnetic excitations along the nodal direction show significant softening. These results establish the presence of strong magnetic correlations in electron-doped (Sr<sub>1−x</sub>La<sub>x</sub>)<sub>2</sub>IrO<sub>4</sub> with close analogies to the hole-doped cuprates, further motivating the search for high temperature superconductivity in this system.</p>

  <span class="abstract hidden">
    <p>Measuring how the magnetic correlations evolve in doped Mott insulators has greatly improved our understanding of the pseudogap, non-Fermi liquids and higherature superconductivity. Recently, photo-excitation has been used to induce similarly exotic states transiently. However, the lack of available probes of magnetic correlations in the time domain hinders our understanding of these photo-induced states and how they could be controlled. Here, we implement magnetic resonant inelastic X-ray scattering at a free-electron laser to directly determine the magnetic dynamics after photo-doping the Mott insulator Sr<sub>2</sub>IrO<sub>4</sub>. We find that the non-equilibrium state, 2 ps after the excitation, exhibits strongly suppressed long-range magnetic order, but hosts photo-carriers that induce strong, non-thermal magnetic correlations. These two-dimensional (2D) in-plane Neel correlations recover within a few picoseconds, whereas the three-dimensional (3D) long-range magnetic order restores on a fluence-dependent timescale of a few hundred picoseconds. The marked difference in these two timescales implies that the dimensionality of magnetic correlations is vital for our understanding of ultrafast magnetic dynamics.</p>

    <p>The electronic phase diagram of the weak spin-orbit Mott insulator (Sr<sub>1−x</sub>La<sub>x</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Ir<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> is determined via an exhaustive experimental study. Upon doping electrons via La substitution, an immediate collapse in resistivity occurs along with a narrow regime of nanoscale phase separation comprised of antiferromag- netic, insulating regions and paramagnetic, metallic puddles persisting until x ≈ 0.04. Continued electron doping results in an abrupt, first-order phase boundary where the Néel state is suppressed and a homogenous, correlated, metallic state appears with an enhanced spin susceptibility and local moments. As the metallic state is stabilized, a weak structural distortion develops and suggests a competing instability with the parent spin-orbit Mott state.</p>

    <p>Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) at the L-edge of transition metal elements is now commonly used to probe single magnon excitations. Here we show that single magnon excitations can also be measured with RIXS at the K-edge of the surrounding ligand atoms when the center heavy metal elements have strong spin–orbit coupling. This is demonstrated with oxygen K-edge RIXS experiments on the perovskite Sr<sub>2</sub>IrO<sub>4</sub>, where low energy peaks from single magnon excitations were observed. This new application of RIXS has excellent potential to be applied to a wide range of magnetic systems based on heavy elements, for which the L-edge RIXS energy resolution in the hard x-ray region is usually poor.</p>

    <p>Recent improvements in instrumentation have established resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) as a valuable new probe of the magnetic excitations in the cuprates. This paper introduces RIXS, focusing on the Cu L<sub>3</sub> resonance, and reviews recent experiments using this technique. These are discussed in light of other experimental probes such as inelastic neutron scattering and Raman scattering. The success of these studies has motivated the development of several new RIXS spectrometers at synchrotrons around the world that promise, among other improvements, 5–10 times better energy resolution. We finish by outlining several key areas which hold promise for further important discoveries in this emerging field.</p>

    <p>The field of superconductivity in the class of materials known as graphite intercalation compounds has a history dating back to the 1960s (Dresselhaus and Dresselhaus, 1981; Enoki et al., 2003). This paper recontextualizes the field in light of the discovery of superconductivity in CaC<sub>6</sub> and YbC<sub>6</sub> in 2005. In what follows, we outline the crystal structure and electronic structure of these and related compounds. We go on to experiments addressing the superconducting energy gap, lattice dynamics, pressure dependence, and how these relate to theoretical studies. The bulk of the evidence strongly supports a BCS superconducting state. However, important questions remain regarding which electronic states and phonon modes are most important for superconductivity, and whether current theoretical techniques can fully describe the dependence of the superconducting transition temperature on pressure and chemical composition.</p>

    <p>The cuprate high temperature superconductors exhibit a pronounced trend in which the superconducting transition temperature Tc increases with the number of CuO2 planes n in the crystal structure. We compare the magnetic excitation spectrum of Bi2+xSr2−xCuO6+d (Bi-2201) and Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10+d (Bi-2223), with n = 1 and 3, respectively, using Cu L3-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering. Near the antinodal zone boundary we find the paramagnon energy in Bi-2223 is substantially higher than that in Bi-2201, indicating that multilayer cuprates host stronger effective magnetic exchange interactions, providing a possible explanation for the Tc vs n scaling. In contrast, the nodal direction exhibits very strongly damped, almost nondispersive excitations. We argue that this implies that the magnetism in the doped cuprates is partially itinerant in nature.</p>

    <p>We report the observation of a bulk charge modulation in La<sub>1.88</sub>Sr<sub>0.12</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> (LSCO) with a characteristic in-plane wave vector of (0.236, ±δ), with δ = 0.011 r.l.u. The transverse shift of the ordering wave vector indicates the presence of rotated charge-stripe ordering, demonstrating that the charge ordering is not pinned to the Cu-O bond direction. On cooling through the superconducting transition, we find an abrupt change in the growth of the charge correlations and a suppression of the charge order parameter indicating competition between the two orderings. Orthorhombic LSCO thus helps bridge the apparent disparities between the behavior previously observed in the tetragonal “214” cuprates and the orthorhombic yttrium and bismuth-based cuprates and thus lends strong support to the idea that there is a common motif to charge order in all cuprate families.</p>

    <p>Materials tuned to the neighbourhood of a zero temperature phase transition often show the emergence of novel quantum phenomena. Much of the effort to study these new effects, like the breakdown of the conventional Fermi-liquid theory of metals has been focused in narrow band electronic systems. Ferroelectric crystals provide a very different type of quantum criticality that arises purely from the crystalline lattice. In many cases the ferroelectric phase can be tuned to absolute zero using hydrostatic pressure or chemical or isotopic substitution. Close to such a zero temperature phase transition, the dielectric constant and other quantities change into radically unconventional forms due to the quantum fluctuations of the electrical polarization. The simplest ferroelectrics may form a text-book paradigm of quantum criticality in the solid-state as the difficulties found in metals due to a high density of gapless excitations on the Fermi surface are avoided. We present low temperature high precision data demonstrating these effects in pure single crystals of SrTiO<sub>3</sub> and KTaO<sub>3</sub>. We outline a model for describing the physics of ferroelectrics close to quantum criticality and highlight the expected 1/T2 dependence of the dielectric constant measured over a wide temperature range at low temperatures. In the neighbourhood of the quantum critical point we report the emergence of a small frequency independent peak in the dielectric constant at approximately 2K in SrTiO<sub>3</sub> and 3K in KTaO<sub>3</sub> believed to arise from coupling to acoustic phonons. Looking ahead, we suggest that in ferroelectric materials supporting mobile charge carriers, quantum paraelectric fluctuations may mediate new effective electron-electron interactions giving rise to a number of possible states such as superconductivity.</p>

    <p>We report a combined experimental and theoretical study of the unusual ferromagnetism in the one- dimensional copper-iridium oxide Sr<sub>3</sub>CuIrO<sub>6</sub>. Utilizing Ir L3 edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, we reveal a large gap magnetic excitation spectrum. We find that it is caused by an unusual exchange anisotropy generating mechanism, namely, strong ferromagnetic anisotropy arising from antiferromag- netic superexchange, driven by the alternating strong and weak spin-orbit coupling on the 5d Ir and 3d Cu magnetic ions, respectively. From symmetry consideration, this novel mechanism is generally present in systems with edge-sharing Cu<sup>2+</sup>O<sub>4</sub> plaquettes and Ir<sup>4+</sup>O<sub>6</sub> octahedra. Our results point to unusual magnetic behavior to be expected in mixed 3d-5d transition-metal compounds via exchange pathways that are absent in pure 3d or 5d compounds.</p>

    <p>One of the most intensely studied scenarios of high- temperature superconductivity (HTS) postulates pairing by exchange of magnetic excitations1. Indeed, such excitations have been observed up to optimal doping in the cuprates2–7. In the heavily overdoped regime, neutron scattering mea- surements indicate that magnetic excitations have effectively disappeared8–10, and this has been argued to cause the demise of HTS with overdoping1,8,10. Here we use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, which is sensitive to complementary parts of reciprocal space, to measure the evolution of the magnetic excitations in La<sub>2−x</sub>Sr<sub>x</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> across the entire phase diagram, from a strongly correlated insulator (x = 0) to a non-superconducting metal (x=0.40). For x=0, well-defined magnon excitations are observed11. These magnons broaden with doping, but they persist with a similar dispersion and comparable intensity all the way to the non-superconducting, heavily overdoped metallic phase. The destruction of HTS with overdoping is therefore caused neither by the general disappearance nor by the overall softening of magnetic excitations. Other factors, such as the redistribution of spectral weight, must be considered.</p>

    <p>A charge modulation has recently been reported in (Nd,Y)Ba<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>6+x</sub> [G. Ghiringhelli et al., Science 337, 821 (2012)]. Here we report Cu L<sub>3</sub> edge soft x-ray scattering studies comparing the lattice modulation associated with the charge modulation in YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>6.6</sub> with that associated with the well-known charge and spin stripe order in La<sub>1.875</sub>Ba<sub>0.125</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub>. We find that the correlation length in the CuO<sub>2</sub> plane is isotropic in both cases, and is 259±9 Å for La<sub>1.875</sub>Ba<sub>0.125</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> and 55±15 Å for YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>6.6</sub>. Assuming weak interplanar correlations of the charge ordering in both compounds, we conclude that the order parameters of the lattice modulations in La<sub>1.875</sub>Ba<sub>0.125</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub>
 and YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>6.6</sub> are of the same order of magnitude.</p>

    <p>We have employed the x-ray resonant magnetic scattering (XRMS) technique at the Ru L2 edge of the Ba(Fe<sub>0.795</sub>Ru<sub>0.205</sub>)<sub>2</sub>As<sub>2</sub> (x = 0.205) superconductor. We show that pronounced resonance enhancements at the Ru L2 edge are observed at the wave vector which is consistent with the antiferromagnetic propagation vector of the Fe in the undoped BaFe2As2. We also demonstrate that the XRMS signals at the Ru L2 edge follow the magnetic ordering of the Fe with a long correlation length, ξ<sub>ab</sub> &gt; 2850 ± 400 ˚A. Our experimental observation shows that the Ru is spin polarized in a(Fe<sub>0.795</sub>Ru<sub>0.205</sub>)<sub>2</sub>As<sub>2</sub> compounds.</p>

    <p>The charge and spin correlations in La<sub>2-x</sub>Ba<sub>x</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub>  (LBCO 1/8) are studied using Cu L<sub>3</sub> edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). The static charge order (CO) is observed at a wave vector of (0.24,0) and its charge nature confirmed by measuring the dependence of this peak on the incident x-ray polarization. The damped spin excitation or “paramagnon” in LBCO 1/8 is then measured as it disperses through the CO wave vector. Within the experimental uncertainty no changes are observed in the paramagnon at that wave vector and the paramagnon seems to be similar to that measured in other cuprates, which have no static CO. Given that the stripe correlation modulates both the charge and spin degrees of freedom, it is likely that subtle changes do occur in the paramagnon due to CO. Consequently, we propose that future RIXS measurements, realized with higher-energy resolution and sensitivity, should be performed to test for these effects.</p>

    <p>We investigate the high-energy magnetic excitation spectrum of the high-T(c) cuprate superconductor Bi<sub>2</sub>Sr<sub>2</sub>CaCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8+δ</sub> (Bi-2212) using Cu L(3) edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering. Broad, dispersive magnetic excitations are observed, with a zone boundary energy of ∼ 300 meV and a weak dependence on doping. These excitations are strikingly similar to the bosons proposed to explain the high-energy "kink" observed in photoemission. A phenomenological calculation of the spin response, based on a parametrization of the the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy derived electronic structure and Yang-Rice-Zhang quasiparticles, provides a reasonable prediction of the energy dispersion of the observed magnetic excitations. These results indicate a possible unified framework to reconcile the magnetic and electronic properties of the cuprates and we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of such an approach.</p>

    <p>The electronic structure of Sr<sub>3</sub>CuIrO<sub>6</sub>, a model system for the 5d Ir ion in an octahedral environment, is studied through a combination of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering and theoretical calculations. Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering spectra at the Ir L3 edge reveal an Ir t2g
 manifold that is split into three levels, in contrast to the expectations of the strong spin-orbit-coupling limit. Effective Hamiltonian and ab inito quantum chemistry calculations find a strikingly large noncubic crystal field splitting comparable to the spin-orbit coupling, which results in a strong mixing of the
j<sub>eff</sub>=1/2 and j<sub>eff</sub>=3/2 states and modifies the isotropic wave functions on which many theoretical models are based.</p>

    <p>Cuprates and other high-temperature superconductors consist of two-dimensional layers that are crucial to their properties. The dynamics of the quantum spins in these layers lie at the heart of the mystery of the cuprates. In bulk cuprates such as La<sub>2</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub>, the presence of a weak coupling between the two-dimensional layers stabilizes a three-dimensional magnetic order up to high temperatures. In a truly two-dimensional system however, thermal spin fluctuations melt long-range order at any finite temperature8. Here, we measure the spin response of isolated layers of La<sub>2</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> that are only one-unit-cell-thick. We show that coherent magnetic excitations, magnons, known from the bulk order, persist even in a single layer of La2CuO4, with no evidence for more complex correlations such as resonating valence bond correlations9,10,11. These magnons are, therefore, well described by spin-wave theory (SWT). On the other hand, we also observe a high-energy magnetic continuum in the isotropic magnetic response that is not well described by two-magnon SWT, or indeed any existing theories.</p>

    <p>We investigate the magnetic polarization of the Ir 5d dopant states in the pnictide superconductor B(Fe<sub>1- x</sub> Ir<sub>x</sub>)<sub>2</sub> As<sub>2</sub> with x=0.027(2) using Ir L3 edge x-ray resonant magnetic scattering (XRMS). Despite the fact that doping partially suppresses the antiferromagnetic transition, we find that magnetic order survives around the Ir dopant sites. The Ir states are magnetically polarized with commensurate stripe-like antiferromagnetic order and long correlations lengths, ξmag&gt;2800 and &gt;850 Å, in the ab plane and along the c axis, respectively, driven by their interaction with the Fe spins. This Ir magnetic order persists up to the Néel transition of the majority Fe spins at T<sub>N</sub>=74(2) K. At 5 K we find that magnetic order coexists microscopically with superconductivity in B(Fe<sub>1- x</sub> Ir<sub>x</sub>)<sub>2</sub> As<sub>2</sub>. The energy dependence of the XRMS through the Ir L3 edge shows a non-Lorentzian line shape, which we explain in terms of interference between Ir resonant scattering and Fe nonresonant magnetic scattering.</p>

    <p>Graphene phonons are measured as a function of electron doping via the addition of potassium adatoms. In the low doping regime, the in-plane carbon G peak hardens and narrows with increasing doping, analogous to the trend seen in graphene doped via the field effect. At high dopings, beyond those accessible by the field effect, the G peak strongly softens and broadens. This is interpreted as a dynamic, nonadiabatic renormalization of the phonon self-energy. At dopings between the light and heavily doped regimes, we find a robust inhomogeneous phase where the potassium coverage is segregated into regions of high and low density. The phonon energies, linewidths, and tunability are notably very similar for one- to four-layer potassium-doped graphene, but significantly different to bulk potassium-doped graphite.</p>

    <p>We report combined soft and hard x-ray scattering studies of the electronic and lattice modulations associatedwith stripe order in La<sub>1.875</sub>Ba<sub>0.125</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> and La<sub>1.48</sub>Nd<sub>0.4</sub> Sr<sub>0.12</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub>. We find that the amplitude of both the electronic modulation of the hole density and the strain modulation of the lattice is significantly larger in La<sub>1.875</sub>Ba<sub>0.125</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> than in La<sub>1.48</sub>Nd<sub>0.4</sub>Sr<sub>0.12</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> and is also better correlated. The in-plane correlation lengths are isotropic in each case; for La1.875Ba0.125CuO4, ξ hole = 255 ± 5 A, whereas for La<sub>1.48</sub>Nd<sub>0.4</sub>Sr<sub>0.12</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub>, ξ hole = 111 ± 7 A. We find that the modulations are temperature independent in La1.875Ba0.125CuO4 in the low temperature tetragonal phase. In contrast, in La1.48Nd0.4Sr0.12CuO4, the amplitude grows smoothly from zero, beginning 13 K below the LTT phase transition. We speculate that the reduced average tilt angle in La<sub>1.875</sub>Ba<sub>0.125</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> results in reduced charge localization and incoherent pinning, leading to the longer correlation length and enhanced periodic modulation
amplitude.</p>

    <p>The low-energy phonons of two different graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) have been measured as a function of temperature using inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS). In the case of the non-superconductor BaC<sub>6</sub>, the phonons observed are significantly higher (up to 20%) in energy than those predicted by theory, in contrast to the reasonable agreement found in superconducting CaC<sub>6</sub>. Additional IXS intensity is observed below 15 meV in both BaC<sub>6</sub> and CaC<sub>6</sub>. It has been previously suggested that this additional inelastic intensity may arise from defect or vacancy modes not predicted by theory [d’Astuto et al., Phys. Rev. B 81, 104519 (2010)]. Here it is shown that this additional intensity can arise directly from the polycrystalline nature of the available samples. Our results show that future theoretical work is required to understand the relationship between the crystal structure, the phonons, and the superconductivity in GICs.</p>

  <span class="abstract hidden">
    <p>We present the results of a neutron scattering study of the high-energy phonons in the superconducting graphite intercalation compound CaC<sub>6</sub>. The study was designed to address hitherto unexplored aspects of the lattice dynamics in CaC<sub>6</sub>, and, in particular, any renormalization of the out-of-plane and in-plane graphitic phonon modes. We present a detailed comparison between the data and the results of density-functional theory DFT. A description is given of the analysis methods developed to account for the highly textured nature of the samples. The DFT calculations are shown to provide a good description of the general features of the experi- mental data. This is significant in light of a number of striking disagreements in the literature between other experiments and DFT on CaC<sub>6</sub>. The results presented here demonstrate that the disagreements are not due to any large inaccuracies in the calculated phonon frequencies.</p>

    <p>The applicability of mean field models of ferroelectric and ferromagnetic quantum critical points is examined for a selection of d‐electron systems. Crucially, we find that the tendency of the effective interaction between critical fluctuation modes to become attractive and anomalous as the ordering temperatures tend to absolute zero results in particularly complex and striking phenomena. The multiplicity of quantum critical fields at the border of metallic ferromagnetism, in particular, is discussed here.</p>

    <p>We report Raman-scattering measurements of BaC<sub>6</sub>, SrC<sub>6</sub>, YbC<sub>6</sub>, and CaC<sub>6</sub>, which permit a systematic study of the phonons and the electron-phonon interaction within the doped graphene layers of these compounds. The out-of-plane carbon phonon softens as the spacing of the graphene layers is reduced in the series BaC<sub>6</sub>, SrC<sub>6</sub>, YbC<sub>6</sub>, and CaC<sub>6</sub>. This is due to increasing charge in the π electronic band. Electron-phonon interaction effects between the in-plane carbon modes at 1500 cm<sup>−1</sup> and the  electrons cause a strong nonadiabatic renormalization. As charge is transferred into the  band, these nonadiabatic effects are found to increase concurrent with a reduction in the phonon lifetime.</p>

    <p>Solutions composed of alpha-cyclodextrin, water, and various methylpyridines, in particular, 4-methylpyridine (4MP), undergo reversible liquid-solid transitions upon heating, the crystalline solid phases undergoing further phase transformations at higher temperatures. This unusual behavior has been characterized by an ensemble of measurements, including solubility, differential scanning calorimetry, quasielastic neutron scattering, as well as x-ray powder diffraction. For the alpha-CD/4MP system five crystalline phases have been identified. The unit cell parameters and corresponding changes with temperature indicate a scenario for the crystallization process. A simple model is proposed that mimics the observed disorder-order transition.</p>
